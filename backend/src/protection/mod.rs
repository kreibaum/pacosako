//! Game Protection Module. Here we make sure that only people who own the game
//! can play it.
//!
//! Historically, I had introduced the "safe_mode" flag to games and a client
//! side UUID in local storage. These UUID work as ephemeral keys that can own
//! games as well. We never persist them, so a server restart will restart the
//! safe_mode assignments.
//!
//! We now support users as well. A side of a game can be owned by a user. This
//! allows them to play the game on any device. We still support anonymous
//! users, as before.
//!
//! We'll also assume safe_mode for all games. This is no longer optional.
//!
//! It is possible to lock both sides to the same user. This reduces complexity
//! and I don't believe this ever was very important.
