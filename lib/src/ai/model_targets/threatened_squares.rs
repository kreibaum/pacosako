//! A ml model target that shows all the threatened squares on the board.

/// This is for both players, so we need 128 f32 values of output space.
///
/// If there currently is a lifted piece, this piece is removed before calculating the threats.
/// This means, while lifting and moving a piece, the model must understand that
/// lifting unblocks threats. This may help understand pinning.

/// # Errors
///
/// Returns -1 if the `reserved_space` is less than 128.
/// Returns -2 if there is an error determining the threats.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The ps pointer must be valid.
/// The out pointer must be valid and have at least `reserved_space` reserved.
// SAFETY: there is no other global function of this name.
