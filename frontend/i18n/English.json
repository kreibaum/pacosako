  "tutorial00ClickToEnableYoutube": "Click to enable video. By clicking, you'll load content from YouTube.",
  "tutorial01Introduction1": "An Introduction to Paco Ŝako",
  "tutorial01Introduction2": "Paco Ŝako is a game about Peace created by the Dutch Artist Felix Albers. The name Paco Ŝako means \"Peace Chess\" in Esperanto, the language of peace.",
  "tutorial01Introduction3": "This first part of the tutorial is also available in English on Youtube, if you prefer to learn from a video.",
  "tutorial02Movement1": "The Movement of Pieces",
  "tutorial02Movement2": "Each Paco Ŝako piece moves in the same way as a traditional chess piece. This tutorial assumes you already have a basic understanding of chess.",
  "tutorial02Movement3": "Here is an opening from a game of Paco Ŝako where some regular moves are played. Click or tap to play!",
  "tutorial02Movement4": "While these moves follow the rules of chess, you'll find the look quite reckless. Both players place their valuable pieces directly on threatened squares. What is going on here?",
  "tutorial03CreateUnion1": "Creating a Union",
  "tutorial03CreateUnion2": "In Paco Ŝako you never remove the other player's pieces. Instead you have the option to unite your piece with their pieces. Both player's pieces remain on the board. Play the animation to see this in action!",
  "tutorial04MoveUnion1": "Moving a union",
  "tutorial04MoveUnion2": "Once united, both players can keep on playing with that union. You may only move the union according to the rules of movement of your own piece.",
  "tutorial04MoveUnion3": "If your piece is in a union, we are calling it \"united\". You can not move a piece out of the union on its own. You always have to take its parter as well. To free your piece from a union, another piece must take over.",
  "tutorial05TakeOverUnion1": "Taking over a Union",
  "tutorial05TakeOverUnion2": "You can take over a union by playing one of your pieces into a union and replacing your original piece. You can then place the free piece according to its movement rules in the same turn.",
  "tutorial05TakeOverUnion3": "Instead of moving from the union to an open square, the freed piece can also be used to create a new union.",
  "tutorial06ChainReaction1": "The Chain Reaction",
  "tutorial06ChainReaction2": "It is also possible to take over another union. This creates a chain reaction.",
  "tutorial06ChainReaction3": "Chain reactions move a lot of your pieces at the same time. They are a powerful way to reshape your position on the board and have an outstanding impact on the gameplay. As you gain experience, you'll be able to find longer and longer chains to do more in a single move.",
  "tutorial07EndGoal1": "The End Goal",
  "tutorial07EndGoal2": "The end goal is to be the first player to unite one of your pieces with the other player's king. This means the king can never form a union, start a chain or be used in a chain.",
  "tutorial07EndGoal3": "You now know the basic rules of Paco Ŝako and are ready to play a game. You can play online with a friend or you can join our community Discord to find somebody to play with.",
  "tutorial08Promotions1": "Pawn Promotions",
  "tutorial08Promotions2": "A pawn that reaches the opposite side of the board must be promoted to a different piece. The player who owns the piece gets to chose one of \"queen\", \"knight\", \"bishop\" or \"rook\".",
  "tutorial08Promotions3": " A difference in Paco Ŝako is, that a pawn can be moved to the opposite side of the board as part of a union. In this case it also promotes and it is still the owner of the pawn who decides the promotion.",
  "tutorial09Castling1": "Castling",
  "tutorial09Castling2": "Castling is a special move which moves the king two squares toward a rook and then moving the rook to the square that the king passed over.",
  "tutorial09Castling3": "To castle, select the king first. You'll be offered an option to move it two squares. The rook will be moved for you automatically.",
  "tutorial09Castling4": "You are only allowed to castle, if neither the king nor the rook has moved before. All squares between the pieces must be empty. Any square the king moves over can not be threatened.",
  "tutorial09Castling5": "In Paco Ŝako, this also includes any threat that is created through a chain. This sometimes makes it hard to know, if you are actually allowed to castle. When playing on this website, you can just lift the king and it will only offer you to castle when it is allowed.",
  "tutorial09Castling6": "Castling at the right moment or denying your opponent the opportunity to castle, is often an important part of the stategy.",
  "tutorial10EnPassant1": "En Passant",
  "tutorial10EnPassant2": "En passant is a special way for a pawn to form a union. Directly after a pawn is moved two squares at once, the opponents pawns are allowed to unite with it, as if it only moved a single square.",
  "tutorial10EnPassant3": "On this website you will be offered the move, whenever you lift a pawn that is allowed to unite en passant.",
  "tutorial10EnPassant4": "In Paco Ŝako, en passant is allowed at the start, in the middle and at the end of a chain.",
  "tutorial11MoreAboutChains1": "Learn more about Chains from Felix",
  "tutorial11MoreAboutChains2": "You can learn more about chains and loop from Felix Albers, the creator Paco Ŝako. This video gives a short recap of this tutorial and then more aspects and situations of the game in the second part of the video at 1:10.",
